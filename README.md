## Demo 💻
![Demo Video](/assets/studentportal.gif)
## Deployed Application 💻 : https://bwg-student-portal.herokuapp.com/
## Description 🧐
This project is a dashboard for students of the Bodyweight Gym, a small studio gym located in Perth, Western Australia. The application brings together useful functionality to students and clients in to one place, presenting each student with a customised dashboard displaying information specific to their practice. 
## Motivation 🚀
Students and clients of the gym had to juggle many applications and webpages throughout training and administering processes. I wanted to bring all their needs within one application. 
## Installation 🛠️
Clone the repo, npm install, npm start. You're off and racing. 
## Usage 🏃‍♀️
Visit the deployed project. While anyone can create a login and enter the dash board, only current financial members of the gym will recieve a customised render of the dashboard
